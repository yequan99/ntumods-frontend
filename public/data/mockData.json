        "description": "Computational thinking (CT) is the process of analysing a problem then designing and expressing its solution in such a way that a computer can effectively carry it out. It includes a number of characteristics, such as breaking a problem into small and repetitive ordered steps, logically ordering and analyzing data and creating solutions that can be effectively implemented as programs running on computer. The aim of this course is hence to take students with no prior experience of thinking in a computational manner to a point where you can derive simple algorithms and code the programs to solve some basic problems in your domain of studies. Student will also learn about basic program construct and simple data structures. In addition, the course will include topics to appreciate the internal operations of a processor.",

        "description": "This course will start with the core principles of Data Science, and will equip you with the basic tool and techniques of data handling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, data-based inference, and data-focussed communication. The course will also introduce you to the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence - state space representation, uninformed search, and reinforcement learning. The course will motivate you to work closely with data and make data-driven decisions in your field of study. The course will also touch upon ethical issues in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, and motivate you to explore the cutting-edge applications related to Big Data, Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Python will be the language of choice to introduce hands-on computational techniques.",

        "description": "Cloud computing refers to both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and the modern applications powered by these services, collectively known as Software as a Service (SaaS), IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service). This course introduces the students to the basic concepts and theory behind cloud computing. Techniques and algorithms in distributed computing that leverages artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchains, topics that forms an integral part of modern cloud computing and edge/fog computing, will also be covered, along with industrial perspectives. Upon completion, students will be able to understand cloud computing applications that use software frameworks, e.g., MapReduce/Spark, distributed computing services-including database, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.",
